# tcp_ip

User-space TCP/IP stack

## Features

#### IPv4

- IPv4 fragmentation and reassembly is supported.
- IPv4 options are not supported and are silently ignored.

#### IPv6

- In development, currently does not support any extended protocols.

#### UDP

Use UdpSocket. Supported over IPv4 and IPv6.

#### ICMPv4 & ICMPv6

Use IcmpSocket or IcmpV6Socket. The user needs to handle the ICMP header themselves and calculate the checksum.

#### TCP

Use TcpListener and TcpStream. Supported over IPv4 and IPv6.

- MSS is negotiated
- Window scaling is negotiated.
- Reassembly of out-of-order segments is supported
- The timeout waiting time is fixed and can be configured
- Selective acknowledgements permitted. (Proactively ACK the need for improvement)

#### Other

Using IpSocket to send and receive packets of other protocols.(Handles all IP upper-layer protocols without requiring
the user to consider IP fragmentation.)
